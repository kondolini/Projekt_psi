    "## Racing Commentary Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Ran On\" (RnOn) - Detailed Meaning:\n",
    "In greyhound racing, **\"Ran On\"** is a **positive performance indicator** that means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Strong Finish**: The dog accelerated or maintained strong pace in the final portion of the race\n",
    "2. **Late Speed**: Shows the dog has stamina and finishing kick\n",
    "3. **Closing Ground**: Often indicates the dog was gaining on leaders or maintaining position strongly\n",
    "4. **Good Fitness**: Suggests the dog is in good racing condition\n",
    "5. **Distance Suitability**: May indicate the dog suits longer distances where stamina matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is GOOD performance** - it shows the dog finished the race strongly rather than tiring. Dogs that \"run on\" are often considered to have good racing fitness and potential for improvement at longer distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contrast with negative terms**:\n",
    "- \"Tired\" = Dog slowed significantly in final stretch\n",
    "- \"Faded\" = Dog lost position/pace late in race\n",
    "- \"Weakened\" = Dog showed lack of stamina\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset appears designed for predictive modeling of greyhound race outcomes, with features capturing both historical performance and race-day factors that influence results."
