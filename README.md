# Data Model for Greyhound Racing

We propose three main classes – **Race**, **Dog**, and **Track** – to capture the rich, structured data of greyhound racing. Each **Race** object holds its basic metadata (date, distance, class, prizes, etc.) and references to participating dogs and the track.  In particular, we include a `rainfall_7d` attribute (a 7-element vector of recent rainfall) because track conditions are highly weather‐dependent – official track guidelines note that **“weather is the main external factor”** affecting track preparation (with rainfall explicitly affecting how wet or “sloppy” the sand becomes).  Empirical analysis of horse races likewise shows that persistent rain (turning turf soft/yielding) forces horses to expend extra energy and yields slower race times.  By analogy, a greyhound race class should store the amount of rain over the past week to let a model account for how a muddy or dry surface might alter performance.

* **Race class:** include fields like `race_date`, `race_time`, `race_class`, `distance`, `prizes`, etc.  Also include a reference to a **Track** object and a list of the participating **Dog** objects (with their trap numbers and results).  Crucially, add a `rainfall_7d` array (e.g. millimeters of rain each day for the 7 days before the race) so the model can learn how recent weather affected that race.

* **Track class:** include the track’s identity (name, location or region) and static properties (surface type/geometry).  Real-world track maintenance manuals emphasize monitoring moisture at each track, e.g. using probes and weather stations to keep the surface consistent.  For example, overly wet (“sloppy”) or overly dry conditions are known to alter greyhound exertion and injury risk.  The Track class could store typical baseline conditions (like optimal water content or sand type) and facilities (e.g. drainage, covers).  It should be linked from each Race so that race-specific preparation (given the same Track) can be combined with weather history.

* **Dog class:** store each individual greyhound’s static attributes and dynamic history.  Static attributes include `dog_id`, `name`, trainer, birth date, weight, color, etc.  Crucially, for performance modeling we attach the dog’s past race results: an *ordered list* of prior Race entries (each with date, position, time, etc.) – this gives the dog’s historical form.  (We expect dogs to run many races; for example, databases often show dozens of races per dog – one greyhound’s record was listed as “55 races” – and while very few exceed \~150, our class should allow arbitrarily long race histories.)  The Dog class should also capture **lineage**: references to its `sire` and `dam` (each of which can be another Dog object), forming a pedigree tree.  Greyhound pedigree databases routinely trace at least 5–6 generations of ancestry. We will store each dog’s full ancestry tree (as nested objects or IDs) but only include the immediate parent references in each Dog instance – for example, the dam’s own pedigree is stored in the dam’s object, not duplicated in the child.

With this structure, each Dog object implicitly embeds a pedigree **tree**, and each Race links together many Dog objects.  For model input, we will **flatten** these structures into fixed‐size features.  One approach is to compute a performance rating for each dog from its race history – analogous to Elo ratings in chess.  In fact, racing analytics often use Elo or similar methods to aggregate career performance: an Elo-based index can capture a horse’s entire career performance across wins, placings, and earnings.  Likewise, we could compute an **Elo rating** (or other ranking score) from each greyhound’s past finishes to summarize its ability.

Alternatively (or additionally), we might convert each dog’s race history into feature vectors: for example, summary stats (wins, average speed, etc.) or a sequential embedding of the ordered race outcomes.  Pedigree data can similarly be encoded.  In genetics and risk prediction, pedigrees are often represented as directed graphs (parents→offspring) and then flattened to fixed-size matrices for neural nets.  For instance, one method builds a matrix \$H\$ whose rows are individuals (ancestors) with columns for features and pointers to their parent indices.  We can adopt similar encoding: e.g. enumerating all known ancestors up to a cutoff generation and including each ancestor’s attributes, or applying graph/sequence embedding techniques to the pedigree.  The key is to turn the variable‐size dog-history and family‐tree into a consistent input.

**Performance/Rating Calculation:**  As a concrete example, an *Elo-like rating* can be derived from the chronological race results of each dog.  This captures how a dog performed *relative to its competition over time*.  Research in equine sports notes that an Elo-based index “allows evaluation of a horse by considering various different traits such as wins, placings, earnings over the entire career altogether”.  In practice, we would run through each past race, updating the dog’s rating based on finishing order (perhaps weighted by class/distance), yielding a single score per dog for model training.  This is just one way to flatten the time-series performance data; other detailed representations (like sequences or summary stats of the last N races) could preserve more nuance if needed.

**Summary:**

* **Race**: fields like `race_id, date, time, distance, class, prizes, Track track, List<Dog> participants, float[7] rainfall_7d, …`.  (Rainfall is an explicit 7-day vector to capture how recent precipitation altered track conditions.)

* **Dog**: fields like `dog_id, name, trainer, birth_date, weight, color, sire, dam, List<Race> past_races, …`.  (Past races should be ordered chronologically and can be used for performance features or to compute an Elo-like rating.  Sire/dam link builds a pedigree tree; databases routinely trace greyhound lineage 5+ generations.)

* **Track**: fields like `track_id, name, location, surface_type, …`.  (Track objects represent each venue.  Tracks actively monitor conditions – e.g. rainfall, moisture – because surface moisture content strongly affects safety and speed.)

These classes capture all necessary details: race metadata, weather (rainfall vector), dog pedigrees, and performance histories.  When preparing data for a learning model, we can flatten each Dog’s history into features (e.g. computing a career Elo score or encoding sequences of past finishes), and similarly encode pedigree trees in a fixed-size form (e.g. a matrix of ancestor features). This rich, object‐oriented schema (with citations above) ensures no critical detail is lost while still yielding a consistent input format for modeling.
